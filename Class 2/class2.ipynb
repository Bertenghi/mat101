    "\n",
    "In mathematics, a function from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ assigns to each element $x \\in X$ exactly one element $y \\in Y$. We commonly denote such a function $f$ by $f: X \\to Y$ and thus require that $\\forall x \\in X, \\exists ! y \\in Y : f(x)=y$. We often refer to $x \\in X$ as the *argument* of a function and $y=f(x)$ as the *image* of $x$ under the function $f$. For example:\n",

    "$$ \\text{sqr}: \\begin{cases} \\mathbb{Z} & \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\\\ x & \\longmapsto x^2 \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "defines a function sqr from the integers to the integers that returns the square of its input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematics is a very strict discipline in the sense that with respect to the above notation one is not allowed to compute sqr($\\pi$) because $\\pi \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$ and hence sqr($\\pi$) is undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can also be *recursive*: a recursive function can be defined as a function that calls itself directly or indirectly. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{fib} : \\begin{cases} \\mathbb{N}& \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{N} \\\\ n & \\longmapsto \\text{fib}(n-1)+ \\text{fib}(n-2) \\end{cases}, \\qquad \\text{fib}(0)=0, \\ \\text{fib}(1)=1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "is a recursive function. \n",
    "\n",
    "### In Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the story is similar although not as rigid as in mathematics. Since this is a course in programming (and not directly in abstract mathematics), from here on now when we use the word function we refer to a function in the sense of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are reusable pieces of programs. They allow you to give a name to a block of statements, allowing you to run that block using the specified name anywhere in your program any number of times. We have already used many built-in functions such as *len* or *range*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, functions are defiend using the **def** keyword. After this keyword comes an *identifier* name for the function $f$ (such as sqrt), followed by a pair of parenthesis which may enclose some names of *parameters*, and by the final colon that ends the line. In the *body* of the function follows a block of statements (code) that are part of this function."
