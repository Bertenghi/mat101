    "1. Study the code and look for mistakes, particularly if your program executes but doesn't produce the result you were looking for.\n",

    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise should make you familiar with debugging and working with code you haven't written yourself. The functions `factorial` and `sum_list` are given but each have an error in their implementation. For both functions, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Give at least two examples of inputs for which the result is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Give at least three examples of inputs that produce a wrong output.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Using a debugging tool of your choice, find out where the error is and provide a fixed version of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Solution</summary>\n",
    "  \n",
    "For the `factorial` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) It holds that $0!=1$ and $1!=1$, both inputs are correctly returned by the factorial function. \n",
    "- The function also correctly detects if num is not an integer, say factorial(3.14) or factorial(\"abc\") both print a warning and return None.\n",
    "- Further, if num is negative, the function prints a warning and returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) For any integer $n \\geq 2$ the function produces a wrong result. For example:\n",
    "- factorial(2)=1 should be 2\n",
    "- factorial(10)=10 should be $10!=3628800.$\n",
    "- factorial(11)=11 should be $11! \\gg 11$. \n",
    "\n",
    "c) The mistake lies in the while loop, we need to adjust the while loop to read `while num >= 1:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `sum_list` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) \n",
    "- If the first element of the sum is not a number, then sum_list correctly returns the sum of the remaining list.\n",
    "- If the list does not include any numbers, then the sum correctly returns 0.\n",
    "- If array is not a list, the function correctly detects this as an error an returns 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) If the first element of the array is a number, then it incorrectly gets ignored. For example:\n",
    "- sum_list([2,3])=3 but should return 5.\n",
    "- sum_list([2, \"abc\"])=0 but should return 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The mistake was in the for loop that generates the index for the array, it starts at 1 but Python is `0`-indexed and therefore the first element of the array always gets ignored. The correct for loop would be `for index in range(len(array)):`.\n",
